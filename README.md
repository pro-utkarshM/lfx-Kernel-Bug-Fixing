# LFX Kernel Bug Fixing Project

Welcome to the LFX Kernel Bug Fixing project! This project aims to address and fix bugs within the Linux kernel. Your contributions play a crucial role in improving the stability and reliability of the kernel.

## Prerequisites

Before you start contributing to this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Linux Kernel Development Knowledge**: It's essential to have a good understanding of kernel development concepts, including how the kernel works, its source code structure, and its debugging tools.

2. **Development Environment Setup**: Ensure that you have a development environment set up with all the necessary tools, including a compiler, build tools, and debugging tools. You can follow the Linux kernel's documentation for setting up your development environment.

3. **Git**: Familiarize yourself with Git version control. You will be working with the kernel's source code, and a solid understanding of Git is essential.

4. **Kernel Bug Tracking**: Understand how to navigate and search the kernel bug tracker. You'll use this to find and choose bugs to work on.

5. **Kselftest**: Learn how to use the Kselftest suite to test changes you make to the kernel. Kselftest helps ensure your changes don't introduce new issues.
